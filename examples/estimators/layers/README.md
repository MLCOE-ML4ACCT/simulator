# Example Usage of TensorFlow Layers

This directory contains examples of how to use the custom TensorFlow layers directly, without the `EstimatorFactory`.

## `basic_layer_usage.py`

This example demonstrates the basic workflow of using a layer:

1.  Instantiate the layer.
2.  Load the weights from its configuration.
3.  Create a dummy input tensor.
4.  Run a prediction.
